# Feeding young patients in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit
  - The attached flowchart shows the decision making process for feeding patients in paediatric intensive care units (PICU) in a hospital.
  - Patients, depending on their condition, are classed as High Risk or Low Risk as shown in attached feeding decision making chart. Any other category is to be ignored. Patients are assessed by specialist nurses every few hours and their feeding maybe adjusted based on
the various data that are recorded.
  - The hospital is looking to create a decision support system for the nurses to allow for speed, accuracy and consistency of the process. You are required to produce the core of the system that processes the data and allows the nurse to make an informed decision, quickly and
consistently
